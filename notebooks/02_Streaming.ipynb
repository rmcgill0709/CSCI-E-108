    "The United States Geological Survey (USGS) maintains over 13,500 stream flow gages in the United States. Measurements from most of these gages are recoded every 15 min and uploaded every 4 hours are [available for download](https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis/rt). Stream flow data are used as inputs for complex water management tasks for purposes such as agriculture, residential use and conservation. For this assignment you will work with the time series of measurements for two stream flow gages on tributaries of the the Columbia River in the US State of Washington.     \n",
